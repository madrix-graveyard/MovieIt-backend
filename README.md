# MovieIt!
## By That's What the code Said! ðŸ˜‰

In this time when there are multiple video streaming websites there is enough mess already that we have to do a search just for getting some recommendations in movies.
Not anymore, We present to you an application which will just do this job for you.
Powered on its 45k+ movies dataset.

Link for the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/download

The data is then processed with cosine similarity methods from sklearn library using TfidfVectorizer() method of the Same.

The dataset is a collection of various features including titles, overview, year-released, and languages too.

We take input from user which is easy to give, just a touch or a click or if a user wishes he/she may enter a title on whose basis movies must be recommended. We do that as well.

Then with just a click a response will be provided containing best fits of recommendation on the basis of the genres selected or the data that has been provided.

Backend is developed in django framework for python.



## Initiating the react based frontend.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
